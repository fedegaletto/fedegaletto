## Research

My research focusses on some aspects of volcanology and volcano-tectonic that have always fascinated me, such as the processes determining the long-term and the short-term deformations in volcanic areas, the mechanisms of magma propagation and eruption forecasting. 
I have used different techniques such as InSAR, geodetic modelling, thermal models and analogue models.
